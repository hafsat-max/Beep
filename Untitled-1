ONE OF THE CHALLENGES STUDENTS INTERESTED IN BECOMING DEVELOPERS ARE FACING IS NOT KNOWING THE RIGHT CHANNELS WHERE THEY CAN LEARN FROM OR SOMETIMES IS THE ISSUE OF NOT HAVING ADEQUATE FACILITIES ON GROUND FOR LEARNING. MY DEPARTMENT AS A CASE STUDY, FEW OF THEM THAT HAS COME ACCROSS ME WRITING CODES ALWAYS ASKS A COMMON QUESTION. I WANT TO BE A DEVELOPER BUT I DONT KNOW WHERE TO START FROM. I HAVE HELPED A FEW OF THEM START A CARREER AND ALSO SOME OF MY FRIEND BY HELPING THEM WITH MY EXISTING KNOWLEDGE OF WEB DEVELOPMENT AND ALSO GIVING THEM SOME TUTORIAL VIDEOS TO LEARN FROM. BUT ONE EFFECTIVE WAY OF LEARNING IS IN GROUPS AND TEAMS, THIS WAY ONE CAN KEEP TRACK ON THE PROGRESS OF THE INTENDING DEVELOPER AND ALSO ORGANIZE CODELABS TO IMPROVE THEIR EXISTING SKILL.
