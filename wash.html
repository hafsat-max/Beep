<!--. Hand Sanitisers are good tools to keep your hands clean but they should not replace soap and water. Sanitisers should be used only after hand washing. Excess use of sanitisers can cause dry and chapped hands due to their high alcohol content.

2. For younger kids, during hand wash sing a song that lasts 30 seconds to reinforce the habit of cleaning their hands properly.

Let them help you in buying soap or toiletries. Sprinkle some glitter on their hands and ask them to clean it , though it may take surprisingly long to wash.

Make a habit to wash your hands 

before and after eating
after playing outdoors
after using toilets
after sneezing or coughing
before and after being around with someone who is ill.
It may seem a small gesture but it has a big impact in ensuring you stay healthy.*///
